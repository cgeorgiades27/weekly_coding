## Weekly Coding Problem

### Week 31, 2021

This problem was asked by Citrix.

You are given a circular lock with three wheels, each of which display the numbers `0` through `9` in order. Each of these wheels rotate _clockwise_ and _counterclockwise_.

In addition, the lock has a certain number of _"dead ends"_, meaning that if you turn the wheels to one of these combinations, the lock becomes stuck in that state and cannot be opened.

Let us consider a _"move"_ to be a rotation of a single wheel by one digit, in either direction. 

Given a lock initially set to `000`, a target combination `C`, and a list of dead ends `XP`, write a function that returns the minimum number of moves required to reach the target state, or `None` if this is impossible.

For example:
 
`C = 456`  
`XP = [999, 672]`

return `13`  

`0->1->2->3->4` 4 moves  
`0->1->2->3->4->5` 5 moves  
`0->9->8->7->` 4 moves
