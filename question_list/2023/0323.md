# Week 03, 2023 - Convert to Base Two

Given a non-negative integer `n`, convert `n` to base 2 in string form. Do not use any built in base 2 conversion functions like bin.

Here's an example and some starter code:

```python
def base_2(n):
  # Fill this in.

print(base_2(123))
# 1111011
```
In the above example, 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 123.
