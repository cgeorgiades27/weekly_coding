## Weekly Coding Problem

### Week 24, 2022 - (Hard)

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index `i` of the new array is the product of all of the numbers in the original array except the one at `i`.

For example, if our input was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the expected output would be `[120, 60, 40, 30, 24]`. If our input was `[3, 2, 1]`, the expected output would be `[2, 3, 6]`.
