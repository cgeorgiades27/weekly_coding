# Weekly Coding Problem

## Week 42, 2022

This problem was recently asked by **Google**:

A look-and-say sequence is defined as the integer sequence beginning with a single digit in which the next term is obtained by describing the previous term. An example is easier to understand:

Each consecutive value describes the prior value.
```console
1      #
11     # one 1's
21     # two 1's
1211   # one 2, and one 1.
111221 # #one 1, one 2, and two 1's.
```
Your task is, return the `nth` term of this sequence.
