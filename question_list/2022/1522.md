### This problem was asked by **Google Code Jam**

<br />

A secret team of programmers is plotting to disrupt the programming language landscape and bring punched cards back by introducing a new language called ***Punched Card Python*** that lets people code in Python using punched cards! Like good disrupters, they are going to launch a viral campaign to promote their new language before even having the design for a prototype. For the campaign, they want to draw punched cards of different sizes in ASCII art.

<br />

<br />

The ASCII art of a punched card they want to draw is similar to an **R** x **C** matrix without
the top-left cell. That means, it has (**R ⋅ C**) − **1** cells in total.
Each cell is drawn in ASCII art as a period (`.`) surrounded by dashes (`-`) above and below, pipes (`|`) to the left and right, and plus signs (`+`) for each corner. Adjacent cells share the common characters in the border. Periods (`.`) are used to align the cells in the top row.
<br />
<br />

For example, the following is a punched card with **R = 3** rows and **C = 4** columns

```
..+-+-+-+
..|.|.|.|
+-+-+-+-+
|.|.|.|.|
+-+-+-+-+
|.|.|.|.|
+-+-+-+-+
```
<br />

There are more examples with other sizes in the samples below. Given the integers **R** and **C** describing the size of a punched card, print the ASCII art drawing of it as described above.

<br />

### Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, **T**.**T** lines follow, each describing a different test case with two integers **R** and **C**: the number of rows and columns of the punched card that must be drawn.

<br />

### Output

For each test case, output one line containing `Case #x:` where `x` is the test case number (starting from 1). Then, output **(2 ⋅ R) + 1** additional lines with the ASCII art drawing of a punched card with **R** rows and **C** columns.

### Limits

Time limit: 5 seconds

Memory limit: 1 GB

### Test Set 1 (Visible Verdict)

**1≤T≤81**

**2≤R≤10**

**2≤C≤10**

### Sample Input
```
3
3 4
2 2
2 3
```
### Sample Output
```
Case #1:
..+-+-+-+
..|.|.|.|
+-+-+-+-+
|.|.|.|.|
+-+-+-+-+
|.|.|.|.|
+-+-+-+-+
Case #2:
..+-+
..|.|
+-+-+
|.|.|
+-+-+
Case #3:
..+-+-+
..|.|.|
+-+-+-+
|.|.|.|
+-+-+-+
```

  Sample Case #1 is the one described in the problem statement. Sample Cases #2 and #3 are additional examples. Notice that the output for each case contains exactly **R ⋅ C + 3** periods.
