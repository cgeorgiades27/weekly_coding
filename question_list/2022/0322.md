## Weekly Coding Problem

### Week 03, 2022 - (Hard)

This problem was asked by **Google**.

Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache. It should be able to be initialized with a cache size `n`, and contain the following methods:

`set(key, value)`: sets `key` to `value`. If there are already `n` items in the cache and we are adding a new item, then it should also remove the least recently used item.

`get(key)`: gets the value at key. If no such key exists, return null.

Each operation should run in **O(1)** time.

Example Data:

```
n = 5

input = ["playstation.us", "botnet.ru", "botnet.ru", "playstation.us", "playstation.us", "stonks.com", "playstation.us", "amscotcashadvance.com", "peloton.com", "cannedham.edu", "stonks.com", "amscotcashadvance.com", "playstation.us", "of.com", "of.com", "google.com", "cannedham.edu", "peloton.com", "amscotcashadvance.com", "stonks.com", "google.com", "of.com", "amscotcashadvance.com", "go.dev", "google.com"]
```
