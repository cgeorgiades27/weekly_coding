## Weekly Coding Problem

### Week 33, 2021 

In order to win the prize for most cookies sold, my friend Alice and I are going to merge our Girl Scout Cookies orders and enter as one unit.
Each order is represented by an ```order_id``` (an integer).

We have our lists of orders sorted numerically already, in lists. Write a function to merge our lists of orders into one sorted list.

For example:

``` python
my_list = [3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 15]
alices_list = [1, 5, 8, 12, 14, 19]

# Prints [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 19]
print(merge_lists(my_list, alices_list))
```
### Bonus
Write a function that takes as an input a list of sorted lists and outputs a single sorted list with all the items from each list.
