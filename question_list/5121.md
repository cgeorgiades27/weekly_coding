## Weekly Coding Problem

### Week 51, 2021 - (Medium)

This problem was asked by **MongoDB**.

Given a list of elements ```lst```, find the majority element ```m```, which appears more than half the time. ```half = floor(len(lst) / 2))```

You can assume that such element exists.

For example, given ```[1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1]```, return ```1```.
